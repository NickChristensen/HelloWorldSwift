In our Today data series, the current hour (ie when the time is 12:30, the 12pm hour) shows a vertical cliff (upward) on the chart. That would indicate to me that we have two values for the current hour, maybe start of hour and now? We should treat the start of the current hour as the end of our Today data, as the current hour is not finished yet and we don't know where it will finish.\n\n2. In our Average data series, we are showing nothing for the current hour.
